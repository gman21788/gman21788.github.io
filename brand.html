			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>During the Covid-19 Pandemic, it is difficult for many to enjoy festivities outside of the comfort of their home. Some just want to take extra precautions, but in many<br>
			cities inside dining has been closed or limited, making it harder to make occasions special for the ones they love. <i>Brunch on Your Porch</i> was inspired by a group of<br>
			college student entrepreneurs whose main goal was to find a creative way for people to still enjoy a meal in the comfort of their own home while maintaining social distance<br>
			and decreasing the spread of Covid-19. We have partnered with local businesses in order to support each other during a time where many businesses need that extra support.</p>
			<p>Now people have an alternative option that provides finger foods, champagne, and wine with a nice setting for their special moment. All customers have to do<br> 
			is book their appointment slot with and <i>Brunch on Your Porch</i> will take care of set-up and clean-up. <i>Brunch on Your Porch</i> will also provide all food,<br>
			drinks, and d√©cor, making this a hassle-free experience. Keeping in mind customers who might want their experience in a remote location, <i>Brunch on Your Porch</i> has<br>
			made this an option as well by allowing customers to move their experience wherever they want.</p> 
			Although the Covid-19 pandemic was the motivator for our entertainment business, we hope long after the pandemic is over people everywhere will still have<br>
			<i>Brunch on Your Porch</i> to bring them unforgettable memories and experiences.</p>
